## Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user input. In this specific case, the route `/users/:id` expects an integer ID but doesn't validate the input, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior if the ID is not a number.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that includes comprehensive error handling, ensuring that the application gracefully handles invalid input and prevents unexpected crashes.  This is critical for building robust and reliable applications.
